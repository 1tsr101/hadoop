Hadoop Cluster Configurations

This is intended to help Hadoop Users, specifically users with System Administration background to setup Hadoop quickly and efficiently. 

The config files are from running cluster. Feel free to use them, but please drop an email with your feedback.

I have uploaded a 64-bit version of the latest stable release hadoop-2.6.0 and 2.7.1.

For any help you can reach me at: trainings@netxillon.com

I provide Hadoop Adminstration, DevOps and Advanced Hadoop trainings.

Advanced Hadoop Training: I will be covering topics like: detailed kerberos, Encryption, Centerlized caching, Storage policy, Ranger, Knox, Hadoop Performance Tuning and Production Use cases. Contact me for details.
