# Start Collector first:

flume-ng agent -c conf -f flume/conf/flume_collector.conf -n collector (Name must match the agent name)
flume-ng agent -c conf -f flume/conf/web_server_source.conf -n source_agent (Name must match agent name)


# Change the hostnames/IPs in the config files accordingly.


#Note:
- New deployments do not use flume any more and kafka is doing lot of things.
- But, flume is still a good use case for log aggregatio etc and avoid the overhead of kafka cluster.
