@Netxillon Technologies. These scripts I used for hadoop1.0 and 2.0, please update the service principals accordingly. Example tt, is no longer valid in hadoop2.0.
Well, we can use any name for the service principal, but just to be consistent on naming conventions each service has a respective principal.
