HBase Default Configuration

The documentation below is generated using the default hbase configuration file, hbase-default.xml, as source.

hbase.tmp.dir

    Temporary directory on the local filesystem. Change this setting to point to a location more permanent than '/tmp', the usual resolve for java.io.tmpdir, as the '/tmp' directory is cleared on machine restart.

    Default: ${java.io.tmpdir}/hbase-${user.name}
hbase.rootdir

    The directory shared by region servers and into which HBase persists. The URL should be 'fully-qualified' to include the filesystem scheme. For example, to specify the HDFS directory '/hbase' where the HDFS instance's namenode is running at namenode.example.org on port 9000, set this value to: hdfs://namenode.example.org:9000/hbase. By default, we write to whatever ${hbase.tmp.dir} is set too -- usually /tmp -- so change this configuration or else all data will be lost on machine restart.

    Default: ${hbase.tmp.dir}/hbase
hbase.cluster.distributed

    The mode the cluster will be in. Possible values are false for standalone mode and true for distributed mode. If false, startup will run all HBase and ZooKeeper daemons together in the one JVM.

    Default: false
hbase.zookeeper.quorum

    Comma separated list of servers in the ZooKeeper ensemble (This config. should have been named hbase.zookeeper.ensemble). For example, "host1.mydomain.com,host2.mydomain.com,host3.mydomain.com". By default this is set to localhost for local and pseudo-distributed modes of operation. For a fully-distributed setup, this should be set to a full list of ZooKeeper ensemble servers. If HBASE_MANAGES_ZK is set in hbase-env.sh this is the list of servers which hbase will start/stop ZooKeeper on as part of cluster start/stop. Client-side, we will take this list of ensemble members and put it together with the hbase.zookeeper.clientPort config. and pass it into zookeeper constructor as the connectString parameter.

    Default: localhost
hbase.local.dir

    Directory on the local filesystem to be used as a local storage.

    Default: ${hbase.tmp.dir}/local/
hbase.master.port

    The port the HBase Master should bind to.

    Default: 60000
hbase.master.info.port

    The port for the HBase Master web UI. Set to -1 if you do not want a UI instance run.

    Default: 60010
