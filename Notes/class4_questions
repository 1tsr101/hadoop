why do we need replication of replication? why do we need to have replication of data on the same server again
what was that sdb1 & sdc1, is that new partition for dn1 & dn2
is this similar to RAID 1(mirroring)?
do we need to setup this only if we do not have raid 1 already?
Isnt its a good practice to create these directories on NFS server? other than local?
after chaning any configuration setting , do we need to run --format everytime to reflect the change?
will thses two disks need to be kept in different racks to avaoid data loss
If the disk io speed is different significantly between the local and NFS one, will this cause adverse effect for namenode?
it will be overhead because instead of rsyncing 1 directory it has to copy 2 dirs to DR right?
so which meta data name node is refering to if both mount points are up?
what is the read policy? will it be only from the first disk specified?
does two disk drives follow propotional fill algoritm?
So in that case we dont have control how end clients are sending jobs? they can send any size
