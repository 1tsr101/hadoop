Question 1: Please setup a Hadoop1.0, Single Node or 2 node Cluster depening upon the resources you have.

-> Please make sure the following conditions are met:

1) All daemons like namenode, datanode, jobtracker, tasktracker must run in the cluster( Single node or multinode).
2) Default Block size must be 128 MB.
3) Write the cluster NamespaceID of your cluster (______________).
4) Create a directory /projects on the hadoop cluster and let the following conditions:
	-> set Namespace quota of 10 on the directory.
	-> set Space Quota of 100MB on the directory.
5) use distcp command to copy /projects to /new on the same cluster.
6) Create a list of DataNodes participating in the cluster and save the list in file "list_of_datanodes" on your local machine.

Questions 2:

1) Save the namespace of the Namenode, without using secodary namenode. fsimage and edits file must merger, without stopping the namenode daemon.
2) Set include file, so that no other nodes can talk to the namenode, other then the what are in the include file.
3) Set cluster Re-balancer threshold to 40%.
